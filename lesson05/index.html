            <h5 class='mg'> MINK CREEK |  CLAUDIA ERICKSON </h6>
            <p class='mg'>  
                With the coming of spring there have been spirals of smoke ascending as people try to stay ahead of the weeds that sprout up among the dried stalks of last winter. Ditch banks and barrow pits have been burned off. 
                Orchards have been pruned and fruit trees are filled with blooms. 
                Dandelions are shaking their yellow pompoms everywhere. Alas, there are allergens causing some human grief along with the beauty.</p>
                <p class='mg'> 
                    It is hard to believe but the Mink Creek community has five weddings on the calendar between now and the end of June! 
                    There are lots of preparations underway, big and small. Reports will follow as the events occur.
                    
                    Glen Jepsen was able to take a trip to Texas to spend some time with his son Kyle and Stacy Jepsen and grandchildren. Blessing a grandchild is a treat for this grandfather. 
                    This little girl was named Abigail Jo Jepsen, the Jo in remembering her grandmother, Betty Jo Jepsen. 
                    Kyle lives in the Dallas area where he is a dentist. The family celebrated this fine event with a dinner of Louisiana crayfish, a special treat.

                    It is racing time again for the Kent and ReNae Egley family as they try to attend the races of their son Matt. 
                    Lately he has driven his bright yellow car in a couple of races at the Magic Valley Speedway in Twin Falls, ID.
                    
                    Lana and Ivan McCracken and the family of LaRon and Liesa Baird traveled in the early morning hours one Sunday to make it to Paul, ID. There awaited the blessing of the new granddaughter for the Bairds and a great granddaughter for the McCrackens. 
                    The little girl was named Ruth Magnolia Baird, the first child of James and Rebekah Baird.
