            <h2>GILBERT ARIZONA TEMPLE</h2>
            <p>The joint announcement of The Gila Valley Arizona Temple and Gilbert Arizona Temple was the first 
                temple announcement made by President Thomas S. Monson after he became president of the Church in 
                February 2008. "It is my personal priority to make sure members of the Church have access to the 
                blessings of the temple," said President Monson. "It is here where members learn of their divine 
                origin and destiny; where they are strengthened spiritually as individuals and as families. 
                Temples are sanctuaries from the storms of life."</p>
