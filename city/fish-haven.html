            <section>

            <p>It’s sweltering in Idaho and the Pacific Northwest this week, and farmworkers are among the most vulnerable.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ángeles Cárdenas and her small crew ended their work day earlier than usual on Wednesday — as they likely will 
                for the rest of the week. There were few trees and little shade in the Nampa cornfield where they worked until
                2:30 p.m. The National Weather Service recorded a high of 104 degrees in Nampa by noon.
                <br>
                <br>
                “There are a lot of people who don’t want to do this work,” Cárdenas told the Idaho Statesman over the phone Wednesday.
                <br>
                <br>
                Experts and advocates are calling for caution — and change — as the Northwest rolls through a several-day 
                stretch of extreme heat that has had lethal consequences in the region. Hundreds of deaths in the U.S. and Canada 
                have been linked to the heat wave, especially among people without air conditioning in their homes or workplaces.

                Manual laborers working outside are particularly at risk. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration
                (OSHA) warns that “dozens of workers die every year due to working in the heat, and thousands become ill.” 
                The Oregonian reported the heat-related death of at least one farmworker this week.
                <br>
                <br>
                “These are extreme temperatures; they are outside of the norm,” said Elizabeth Strater, from United Farm
                Workers. “I know that this is a historic heat wave, but I don’t think that it’s going to be in the history 
                books. This is going to happen more and more. And right on the heels of heat like this is going to come fires
                and air that is toxic.”
                <br>
                <br>
                Farmworker advocacy organizations such as UFW say extreme heat in areas where that’s unusual — many places
                in Oregon, Washington state and North Idaho, for instance — is one of the reasons why there need to be stronger 
                federal standards protecting workers from the heat. Strater said many migrate through different states for work,
                but employers in traditionally cooler places might not understand the amplified risks to workers once temperatures 
                soar past 100 degrees.
                <br>
                <br>
                “The lack of federal standards puts workers in every state at risk,” Strater said. “You can’t educate and 
                empower workers about what their rights are. We need a federal standard that acknowledges the real, bare basics 
                needed to save the lives of the men, women and children working in our food supply chain.”</p>
