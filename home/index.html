            <h3>WATER SAFETY IN IDAHO</h3>
            <p>While water is incredible, it can also be incredibly deadly. Every year 3,572 people in the US die from 
                drowning and 945 of them are children. Additionally, for every child that drowns, 5 more are treated in the 
                Emergency Room for near-drowning incidents. Lessons, like those provided at
                     Mountain Wave Swimming, that provide experience on how to react when you fall in the water, lower the risk of drowning 
                     from ages 1-4 by 88%.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     At Mountain Wave Swimming we do everything we can to gently prepare children for unexpected water 
                     encounters. Not only do we teach them how to float, we guide them towards the skills of staying calm, kicking to the 
                     side of the pool, and getting themselves out of the water.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     As children of all ages gain confidence, lessons develop into more than safety preparation, they become a lot of fun. 
                     Even the youngest kids who are learning to walk can begin kicking themselves through the water. Older children almost 
                     immediately begin mastering backstroke and working on skills necessary for front stroke. We truly believe that water 
                     should be a LOT of fun and want to work with you to help your child be safe and excited about swimming!
